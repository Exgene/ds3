tree --
    collection of vertices and edges
        vertex is a node
        edge is the line connecting the vertices

tree terminology
    1. Root
    2. Parent
    3. Child
    4. Siblings
    5. Descendants
    6. Ancestors -- every vertex encountered while moving towards the Root
    7. Degree of a node - num of edges going out of a node
    8. Internal and external nodes (aka leaf and non-leaf nodes)
        - leaf node are nodes with degree 0, aka external node
        - non leaf nodes are also called internal nodes
    9. Levels
    10. Height -- how many edges should we travel from the root to get to the nodes
    11. Forest -- collection of trees


Binary trees :
    - a tree with degree 2 
        ie. every node has utmost 2 nodes (left node and right node)
    - relation b/w Height and num or nodes
        Min nodes = h + 1
        max nodes = 2^(h + 1) - 1
