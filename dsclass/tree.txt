    3. Child
    4. Siblings
    5. Descendants
    6. Ancestors -- every vertex encountered while moving towards the Root
    7. Degree of a node - num of edges going out of a node
    8. Internal and external nodes (aka leaf and non-leaf nodes)
        - leaf node are nodes with degree 0, aka external node
        - non leaf nodes are also called internal nodes
    9. Levels
    10. Height -- how many edges should we travel from the root to get to the nodes
    11. Forest
